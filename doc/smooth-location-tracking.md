# Smooth Location Tracking Implementation

## Overview

In response to Issue #14 "Want smoother tracking of current location", we implemented the following improvements.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dynamic Adjustment of Location Update Frequency

#### Background
Previously, a fixed distanceFilter (10m) was used, which caused updates at the same frequency regardless of zoom level, resulting in inability to track fine movements during detailed display.

#### Implementation (Improved in Issue #76)
Added `adjustUpdateFrequency` method to `LocationManager` to dynamically adjust update frequency based on map camera altitude:

- **Camera Altitude (meters)**: Lower altitude (zoomed in) requires more frequent updates

```swift
func adjustUpdateFrequency(forAltitude altitude: Double) {
    // Calculate distanceFilter based on camera altitude
    // Lower altitude (more zoomed in) means finer updates (smaller distanceFilter)
    
    let newDistanceFilter: CLLocationDistance
    if altitude <= 500 {
        // Very detailed zoom (block level and below)
        newDistanceFilter = 5.0
    } else if altitude <= 2000 {
        // Detailed zoom (district level and below)
        newDistanceFilter = 10.0
    } else if altitude <= 10000 {
        // Standard zoom (city level and below)
        newDistanceFilter = 20.0
    } else {
        // Wide area zoom (wider than city level)
        newDistanceFilter = 50.0
    }
}
```

#### Adjustment Range
- **Minimum distanceFilter**: 5m (altitude 500m or below, block-level detailed display)
- **Maximum distanceFilter**: 50m (altitude over 10000m, wider than city-level display)

### 2. Animation Improvements

#### Background
Default animation caused jitter during frequent location updates.

#### Implementation
Use `interactiveSpring` animation in `MapView`:

```swift
withAnimation(.interactiveSpring(response: 0.3, dampingFraction: 0.8, blendDuration: 0.1)) {
    // Camera position update
}
```

#### Parameter Meanings
- **response**: 0.3 seconds - Animation response speed
- **dampingFraction**: 0.8 - Moderate damping for smooth movement
- **blendDuration**: 0.1 seconds - Blend time with previous animation

### 3. TDD Approach

#### Test Cases
Added the following test cases to verify dynamic update frequency adjustment:

1. **Very Detailed Zoom Test**
   - Altitude: 200m (block level)
   - Expected: distanceFilter = 5m

2. **Wide Area Zoom Test**
   - Altitude: 50000m (prefecture level)
   - Expected: distanceFilter = 50m

3. **Detailed Zoom Test**
   - Altitude: 1000m (neighborhood level)
   - Expected: distanceFilter = 10m

4. **Standard Zoom Test**
   - Altitude: 5000m (ward/city level)
   - Expected: distanceFilter = 20m

## Effects

1. **Intuitive Behavior**: Fine updates during detailed display and coarse updates during wide area display
2. **Battery Efficiency Optimization**: Set appropriate update frequency according to zoom level, reducing wasteful processing
3. **Smooth Movement**: Achieved visually smooth tracking through animation improvements

## Technical Considerations

1. **CPU Load Minimization**: distanceFilter changes are executed only when there's a difference of 2m or more
2. **Asynchronous Processing**: Location information processing is executed asynchronously to maintain UI responsiveness
3. **Simple Decision Logic**: Simple decision based only on altitude, avoiding complex calculations

## Future Improvement Ideas

1. **Introduction of Prediction Algorithm**: Predictive display by forecasting movement direction
2. **Customizable Update Frequency**: Settings that users can adjust according to preference
3. **Battery Saver Mode**: Power-saving option for long-term use
