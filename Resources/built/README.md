# Auto-Generated Files

This directory contains files that are automatically generated during the build process. **Do not edit these files manually** as they will be overwritten.

## Files in this directory

### VersionInfo.plist
- **Generated by**: `scripts/sync-version-info.sh` during build
- **Purpose**: Contains Git-based version information (version string, build number)
- **Source**: Extracted from Git repository metadata
- **Usage**: Read by `SettingsViewModel` for displaying app version information

### Assets.car
- **Generated by**: `scripts/compile-assets.sh` during build
- **Purpose**: Compiled asset catalog for the app
- **Source**: `Resources/source/Assets.xcassets`
- **Usage**: App icons and other assets used by the application

### *.png files
- **Generated by**: Asset compilation process
- **Purpose**: Individual icon files extracted from Assets.car
- **Source**: App icons from the asset catalog
- **Usage**: Various icon sizes for different device types

## Important Notes

- These files are included in `.gitignore` and should not be committed to version control
- If you need to modify version information, update the scripts or Git tags instead
- Asset changes should be made in `Resources/source/Assets.xcassets`
- The build process will automatically regenerate these files as needed

## Regenerating Files

To regenerate the files in this directory:

```bash
# Regenerate version info
make sync-version-info

# Regenerate assets (macOS only)
make compile-assets

# Regenerate everything during build
make build
```
